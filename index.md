### Original Articles

The following links are to pieces that I wrote for my university newspaper. My alma mater rebranded and the site was archived.

[In a While, “Krokodil” (Posted October 24, 2013)](https://web.archive.org/web/20140911194400/http:/www.panthernewsnetwork.com/top-stories/2013/10/24/in-a-while-krokodil/)

Along the streets of Russia, a drug is on the rise. Known for the massive destruction it wrecks upon its users, many people are worried about its increasing prevalence. This opiate is called “krokodil” due to the greenish, scaly skin its users develop.

[Snowflakes: Their Formation and Individuality (Posted March 7, 2014)](https://web.archive.org/web/20140715174440/http:/www.panthernewsnetwork.com/top-stories/2014/03/07/snowflakes-their-formation-and-individuality/)

Spring is almost here! This winter has definitely been rougher than previous years. While it is very pretty to see snow from the inside of a warm house, driving and walking in it are no fun. Spending time during these last few months watching snow slowly pile up on the roads and on my car left me wondering: how exactly does each snowflake form? Why are they often drawn six-sided? And why do we often say that ‘no two snowflakes are exactly alike?’

[The Greatest Threat (Posted October 7, 2014)](https://web.archive.org/web/20141012112707/http:/www.panthernewsnetwork.com/top-stories/2014/10/07/the-greatest-threat/)

There has been an ongoing debate about whether or not vaccines are a good idea or are even safe. There are many concerns about what they actually are, and often it is misunderstanding that prevents people from getting vaccinations. In this article, the intent and process of vaccines will hopefully become clear, and there will be a better understanding of why vaccines are good for both individuals and entire populations as we head straight into flu season.
